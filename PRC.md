# Project Reference & Collaboration (PRC)

## Project Overview
Piximize is a light-weight image resizer that can resize batches of images. It offers only a few options, the right options, to quickly and easily resize images.

## Requirements
- Multiple images can be dragged and dropped into the interface to be resized
- A user can choose the desired width of the resized images. These choices will be 1920, 1440, 1000, 500, or a custom value.
- A user can choose three different formats to export the resized images: JPEG, PNG, and WebP.
- The quality of the exported images defaults to 70%, but it can be adjusted.
- After the images are dropped into the application, the next screen will show them all on a grid. Each image thumbnail will show the new size of the image once it's been resized.
- Clicking on an image will open a preview in a v-dialog that will show the quality of the new image
- Images can be renamed into a sequence with a prefix, or can be left as original filenames
- Images can then be downloaded one by one. I don't want to do any ZIP stuff
